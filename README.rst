**LOTF** is a C++/ROOT track reconstruction algorithm designed for the Straw Tube Tracker in PANDA. If you wish to use it, you better get in contact with me, it was meant as a Ph.D. project and although we obtained quite promising results, there is no plan 
for following up with this project, especially since the PANDA experiment may not exist in the end.

LOTF was published in the following paper:

- `Reconstructing charged-particle trajectories in the PANDA Straw Tube Tracker using the LOcal Track Finder (LOTF) algorithm <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epja/s10050-023-01005-8>`_
